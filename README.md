## Overview

The goal of this project is to learn how to use React to simplify development of a website. The instructor provided HTML and CSS files that were examples of a very simple weight loss tracker. Each module in the bootcamp explained how to convert this webpage into a React website using containers, wrappers and a mock API using a local json server.

### The challenge

Following along with each module, I should learn the following:
- How to convert a standard webpage into one that utilizes React Components
- How to nest components together to make a dynamic webpage
- How to create a simple mock API using json-server
